# unitec-bot

I had the opportunity and time to work on various JavaScript libraries for this project.

React library was used to create the frontend application which returned html and CSS to generate the user interface.

Express, which has become a de-facto standard Framework for majority of Node.js applications that
helps with requests and routing was used as a back-end application Framework build on Google's V8 engine; hosted on Heroku.

To integrate both component, Google DialogFlow was introduced to the application, which is a Google service, an NLP (Natural Language Processing) that translates user input into something that the backend app (bot) will be able to understand.

GitHub was used to track changes, versioning and deploying of the Unitec-bot to Heroku.
